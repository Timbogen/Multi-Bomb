            This project is a multiplayer version of the game "Bomberman".
            In Multi-Bomb 8 players can compete on a map consisting of quadratic fields and try to eliminate each other.
            <br>
            <br>
            Different weapons are available such as Bombs, Arrows and Swords to make the gameplay interesting. Furthermore different collectible buff items are also
            available, which for example affect speed, health or the explosion range of the bombs.
            <br>
            <br>
            On a map there are obstacles, trees which are indestructible and mushrooms which can be destroyed by items. A few maps are included in the game, but new
            ones can easily be created with the built in map editor.
